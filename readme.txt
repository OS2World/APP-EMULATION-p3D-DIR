This is the OS/2 port of p3D-DIR, a program to show the directory
of a disk image file, together with the used disc space.

This program supports the PCW DDSDT discs, so it *should* support
Amstrad and ZX Spectrum +3 emulators.

I rebuilt it from the (included) source using GCC 3.3.5 and the Build
Environment from Paul Smedley, so if you find it useful please
consider making him a donation for his hard work on OS/2.

Have fun!
